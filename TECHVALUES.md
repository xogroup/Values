# Tech Defined Values

**WE ARE GOOD HUMANS**  
The foundation of our values is us: thoughtful, empathetic, accountable, honest, professional, inclusive and respectful human beings. We embody these attributes as we strive to create a supportive community in which we may all succeed.

**WE CONSIDER EVERY USER**  
Behind every metric is a person or a group of people to whom our products provide meaningful impact. We acknowledge the different types of users - couples, wedding guests, parents, vendors, colleagues - and the diversity that exists within each one of these groups. We put the user first and use the right tools to ensure we are implementing the best solution to meet their needs.

**WE TAKE OWNERSHIP**  
If you see something, say something: everyone has a voice and is encouraged to use it. If you see something, do something: everyone is empowered to be resourceful, to make decisions, and to act.

**WE ACHIEVE OUR GOALS**  
We set ambitious and measurable goals, and define a clear path to success. We love following best practices, but we know when to break convention. Our motto is 'build, ship, iterate, repeat'.

**WE IMPROVE CONTINUOUSLY**  
We are agile, quickly adapting so that we can stay competitive in the market and as professionals. We foster a culture of continuous improvement that is reflected in how we manage the product lifecycle, technical implementations and our own personal growth.

**WE CREATE A CULTURE OF LEARNING**  
We push ourselves to continually learn new things and advance our craft. We encourage personal and professional growth by creating spaces for knowledge sharing and creative development. “Stop, start, and continue” is our mantra: we foster a culture of 360 feedback to ensure every member of the team can learn from the praise and constructive criticism of their colleagues.

**WE VALUE TRANSPARENCY**  
We all know exactly how our work is performing. We also know exactly how our teammates are performing. We're open and honest about how we can improve and be our best selves. We use the “squad” structure to promote openness between engineering, product and design so that we can more effectively achieve our goals.

**WE PROTECT SAFE SPACES**  
We take the time to understand each other’s diverse perspectives and ideas and celebrate our unique viewpoints. We only succeed when everyone on the team feels safe to speak up.

**WE ENJOY WHAT WE DO**  
We enjoy the work we do because we know it is meaningful and important to our users. We know how to have a good time. When we are at work, we do our best to encourage an amiable environment. We encourage one another to enjoy a healthy work-life balance.

**WE ARE PART OF THE WHOLE**  
We are proud of the work we do: that of the individual contributor and collectively. Every line of code, every tweaked security setting, every piece of documentation represents the greater effort: building great solutions. We give back through contributions to open source, technical blog articles and participation in professional engagements.
