**LOVE OUR USERS**  
We deeply understand our users and put them at the center of everything we do. We aim to serve and delight them every day.

**DO THE RIGHT THING**  
We respect each other. We act with the highest integrity. If we see something that isnâ€™t right, we say something.

We ask why 5 times to fully understand a perspective, then we fearlessly and respectfully challenge assumptions. We encourage constructive conflict to get to the right answer.

**OWN YOUR OUTCOMES**  
We set clear ambitious goals and play to win. We anticipate obstacles, persevere, and always hold the DRI responsible.

**MAKE FAST DECISIONS**  
We communicate and act with focus and urgency. We either agree, disagree and commit wholeheartedly, or escalate immediately.
