# Our Values

## Motivation

At our bi-annual tech summit in 2016, we identified that our organization lacked consistent principles at the foundation of our decisions and interactions. As a result, we did not have enough:

* Direct challenges of decisions and ideas - especially those communicated from higher up
* Passionate pursuit of organic initiatives that impact our users

*Steve Huffman - CEO of Reddit - says it best: "Values are a tool for making decisions". If we achieve a strong belief in our values, then they can guide our everyday decisions within our work; within our daily interactions; and influence how we think about our users.*

**Our tech organization unanimously decided that we needed to establish core values for our technology organization.**

## The Process

Our goal was to define the tech org's values through an inclusive, collaborative process.

We did this in 3 steps:

1. Collect as many ideas as possible from as many people as possible
2. Through grouping similar ideas and a series of discussions and polls, we'll narrow the larger pool down to smaller one.
3. Crunch these down into our final, beautifully articulated values through a TBD process.

Further validation that we were onto a good thing came when, independent of our efforts, our company's Executive team identified the need to establish company wide values.

We decided to continue our efforts in parallel, and once completed, compare our results with those of the broader company, with 1 of 3 eventual outcomes:

1. Combine our values with those of the company
2. Scrap ours altogether
3. Have ours live as children of the company values, with a very tech specific flavor.

## Tech and Company Values
After a thorough effort, where we:

1. Collected more than [100 ideas](IDEAS.md) from across the tech org
2. Grouped these and drafted them as values in [6 independent efforts](GROUPINGS.md)
3. Took the best of these to form our final values and then associated tech specific tactics with them,

We quite incredibly came up with a set of values that were remarkably similar to those of the company. While the wording and number of values were different, the values instilled in each were much the same. Take a look:

* [Tech defined values](TECHVALUES.md)
* [Company defined values](COMPANYVALUES.md)


## The Outcome
Because of the similarities between the tech values and the company values, we concluded that we should still keep ours as a reference; but align our tech specific tactics that we had originally defined as part of our values with the company values. 

We believe that through living by the company values; and coupling them with tech specific operational items as well as examples of how to apply the values and tactics within the tech org, serves as a strong foundation for guiding our decisions and initiatives. Below you can find the list of operational items that we identified per company value. This is a living breathing list that is open to ammendment by anyone within our tech org.

**LOVE OUR USERS**  

* Technical quality provides user value. We balance speed with quality when building software and understand the importance of both.
* We embrace user stories that voice the problem we are trying to solve from the users' perspective.
* We value user data. We gather data to make decisions using analytics and user testing; allow this data to challenge any preconceived notions we might have.
* We keep the context of our industry relevant by continuously reminding ourselves who our users are.
* We are considerate of those with special needs that are interacting with our products through an accessibility device. We think about how to build our software to include these users.
* We recognize the diversity that exists in our user groups who need our tools to be relevant to them.

**DO THE RIGHT THING**  

* Be a role model: allow your embodiment of these attributes to rub off on others.
* Be considerate of your colleagues that will be supporting your solutions now and in the future.
* Respect the different backgrounds and viewpoints of others and appreciate the value this diversity brings.
* Participate in the recruiting and onboarding process to ensure continuity of culture.

**DEBATE IT** 

* We encourage collaboration and challenging of ideas through:
  * pair programming
  * code reviews
  * brown bag sessions
  * Tech Tuesdays (events where we share ideas with our peers)
* As engineers, we are co-owners of our product goals and are comfortable challenging them.
* We hold team retros after every sprint to reflect on strengths and possible areas of improvement.
* We participate in 360 feedback; normalize praise and constructive criticism by giving feedback regularly.
* We know how to disagree and challenge the idea, not the person.

**OWN YOUR OUTCOMES**  

* Take action: Found an issue with our deploy strategy? Propose a plan to fix it! Found a bug in the code as you were implementing a feature? Write a story for it!
* Leave everything better than it was found. If you can make it better in 5 minutes, do it. If you can't, follow up.
* Our agile process allows ownership of what you build. Starting with Inception gatherings and followed by regular iterative planning meetings, engineers have a say in everything they build.
* Define SMART goals at the individual, team and company level.
* We have a strong focus on engineering career progression, with a well-defined career path and the support structures for you to take ownership of your own progression.
* Find the right path to success: get it done vs. measure twice, cut once.
* Publish your personal goals openly and align them vertically.

**MAKE FAST DECISIONS**  

* A strong focus on test coverage and TDD allows us to have the confidence to react quickly to decisions and change our course.
* We use strong agile processes and tools to ensure we are building software as efficiently as possible.
* We appreicate the approach of build it, ship it and iterate.
* We don't fear failure; we are comfortable failing fast and learning from the experience.

**GET BETTER EVERY DAY**  

* We encourage pair programming and sharing of knowledge in and outside of our teams.
* We protect spaces for creative development and growth, such as 10% time and biannual Hackathons.
* We promote knowledge-sharing through guild meetings, the Mentorship program and XOIT workshops.
* We contribute to the open source community and knowledge share with the greater tech community through Meetups and other community initiatives.
* We recognize that the work we do is a work in progress and code is never finished.
* We challenge existing patterns as the best solution might be an alternative approach.
* We appreciate a growth mindset and self-motivated learners.

## Next Steps
We will continue this initiative by continuing to refine the above lists, and by adding examples of where the company values and the above tactics can be utilized within the day to day efforts of our software teams. We encourage anyone with in the tech org to participate in this process by submitting a PR with changes to this document.
